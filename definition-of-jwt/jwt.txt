JWT - JASON WEB TOKEN

Used for -> AUTHORIZATION

What happend before JWT's

Client used to send sessionIds to server to check if the logged in user has
permit to see that particular thing.

Server saves that session ids somewhere and check the request session id coming
from client everytime.

BEFORE JWTs

Client login (/login) -> Server stores the user in server memory

then

Sever sends SessionId (unique id) as cookie to ->  Client

then

For any future request

Client send requests with SessionId as cookie to -> Server

Now Server gets the user based on the session id sent by Client and veries 
and send back response.

PROBLEM WHAT JWTs TRYING TO SOLVE

JWTs doesnt store anything in the SERVER at all.
